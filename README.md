# SampleBounds
This is a repository for Sample Bounds project under professor Erik Learned Miller. The objective of this project is to derive tight probabilistic bounds on statistical properties (mean, median, variance etc.) of samples drawn from an unknown probability distribution having the following properties -
The distribution is absolutely continuous.
The distribution has defined density.
The distribution has finite support.
The probabilistic bounds must be distribution-free. No strong assumptions about the distribution must be made other than those listed above. We will assume that the samples drawn from the distribution are independent and identically distributed.
